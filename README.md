# Todo-List
Final project of Programming classes in third semester of Computer Science studies.

Project is written in the C++ language and works entirely in a console. As a students we couldn't use STL containers, so the class *Days_List* stores a linked list of *Day* objects, whereas those objects store linked lists of *Tasks* for a particular day.
